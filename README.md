# bubble_sort

### An exercise in Ruby block from [The Odin Project](http://www.theodinproject.com/ruby-programming/advanced-building-blocks).  

This project contains two methods:

bubble_sort in which each element is compared to the one next to it and they are swapped if the one on the right is larger than the one on the left. This continues until the array is eventually sorted

and

bubble_sort_by which sorts an array but accepts a block. The block should take two arguments which represent the two elements currently being compared.
